# Scientific Validity Statement

**Project Sagittarius** is built upon fundamental and widely accepted principles of astrophysics, including **light-time correction**, **parallax-based distance measurements**, and stellar classification using **Gaia DR3 data**. 

## Core Methodology
The framework centers on the reverse-engineering of the 1977 Wow! Signal's possible origin point by:
1. Analyzing candidate stars within the spatial cone of the signal’s detection.
2. Correcting for **light-travel time** to estimate the original transmission date.

The research applies sound selection criteria—including **spectral type**, **stellar stability**, **proper motion**, **metallicity**, and **exoplanetary presence**—to construct a multi-parameter scoring matrix. These methods reflect standard procedures used in exoplanetary science and astrometric modeling, adapted here for the specific needs of retrospective SETI analysis.

## Reproducibility & Future Scope
All filtering thresholds and scoring mechanisms are clearly documented and reproducible. Future phases will employ **proper motion modeling** to simulate the historical positioning of Earth within each candidate star’s sky—a method routinely used in binary star kinematics and orbital simulations. 

## Conclusion
The scientific merit of Project Sagittarius lies in its novel synthesis and redirection of proven astrophysical tools to a persistent, unresolved anomaly. The methods are replicable, the logic is transparent, and the approach offers SETI a scalable new toolset for analyzing historic one-off signals with **forensic precision**.
