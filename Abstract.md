# Project Sagittarius: Abstract

In 1977, the **Wow! Signal** was recorded as a one-time, narrowband radio anomaly with characteristics suggestive of an artificial, non-terrestrial origin. Despite extensive attention, no source has ever been identified. **Project Sagittarius** presents a novel, retrospective approach to SETI analysis, treating the signal as a **solvable cold case** rather than a static mystery.

### The Methodology
This research combines:
* **Light-travel time correction**
* **Gaia DR3 stellar data**
* **Astrometric filtering** The goal is to identify a set of candidate stars within the original signal's coordinate cone and realistic distance window (**100–300 light-years**). Stars were scored based on spectral type, variability, proper motion, metallicity, and exoplanet presence, with one standout candidate hosting a confirmed rocky planet.

### Conclusion
The methodology is fully documented, transparent, and extensible to future or historic anomalies. This framework offers SETI a new toolset: one rooted in reproducible logic and observational science, designed to trace not only where a signal came from — **but when and why we may have received it.**
