# Project Sagittarius: Abstract

In 1977, the *Wow! Signal* was recorded as a one-time, narrowband radio anomaly with characteristics suggestive of an artificial, non-terrestrial origin. Despite extensive attention, no source has ever been identified. *Project Sagittarius* presents a novel, retrospective approach to SETI analysis, treating the signal as a *solvable cold case* rather than a static mystery.

## The Methodology

This research combines:
- **Light-travel time correction (Targeting the year 1702)**
- **Gaia DR3 stellar data interrogation**
- **Astrometric reconstruction** The goal was to identify candidate stars within the original signal's coordinate cone, adjusted for stellar drift over 324 years. By "rewinding" the galaxy to the estimated moment of transmission (c. 1702), this study identifies high-probability origin points that would be missed by modern-day coordinate mapping.

## Conclusion

The analysis successfully identified **Gaia DR3 6765857965600060288**—a stable K-type Orange Dwarf—as the primary candidate. In 1702, this star was positioned within **0.002 degrees** of the signal's center. This methodology offers SETI a new toolset: one rooted in reproducible logic and observational science, designed to trace not only where a signal came from—*but when we were in its line of sight.*
