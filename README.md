Project Sagittarius: Retrospective SETI Analysis
A Forensic Reverse-Mapping of the 1977 Wow! Signal
Project Sagittarius reframes the search for the Wow! Signal origin by treating the 1977 anomaly as a "solvable cold case." By synthesizing Gaia DR3 astrometric data with temporal light-travel correction, this framework identifies and ranks potential stellar sources.

Methodology
Temporal Calibration: Corrects for light-travel time (100-300 ly), placing the original transmission window between 1677 and 1877 CE.

Stellar Filtering: Isolates stars by spectral type (favoring stable G and K-type stars) and metallicity using the Gaia DR3 catalog.

Weighted Scoring: A 0-5 point system evaluating seven critical categories, including photometric stability and proper motion precision.

Forensic Rigor: Includes a dedicated Scientific Validity Statement to account for parallax and motion inaccuracies.

Star ID,Distance,Spectral Type,Exoplanet Status,Score (Max 35)
Gaia DR3 Standout,275 ly,G8V,Confirmed Rocky Planet,30
Gaia Candidate 2,120 ly,G2V,None Known,30
Gaia Candidate 3,150 ly,G0V,None Known,30
NOTE:The G8V standout candidate is the only star in the current pool with a confirmed terrestrial world, making it the primary target for future trajectory modeling.
