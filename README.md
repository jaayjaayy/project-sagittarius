# Project Sagittarius: Retrospective SETI Analysis

### 🕵️ Why This Project? (A Note from the Lead Researcher)

I am a Psychology student (SUNY Empire) and a systems-builder in the Sims 4 ecosystem. To some, an astronomical "cold case" like the Wow! Signal seems out of my lane. To me, it is the ultimate test of **Pattern Recognition.**

My brain works in timelines, systems, and layers. I don't "move on" from mysteries; I carry them forward and build with them. Whether I am diagnosing a software conflict or a 324-year-old stellar drift, the goal is the same: **Find the Truth.**

*Project Sagittarius* isn't just about space; it’s about applying the precision of a psychological forensic audit to the stars. It’s about proving that with the right data (Gaia DR3) and a refusal to accept "placeholder" answers, we can turn a 50-year-old anomaly into a solvable system.

## Methodology
The core of this project is a multi-parameter scoring matrix designed to filter the Sagittarius constellation and identify high-probability origin points using **1702 Spatiotemporal Reconstruction.**

## Candidate Standouts (Validated Data)
The analysis successfully identified a primary candidate that aligns with the Wow! Signal coordinates when adjusted for three centuries of stellar proper motion.

| Star ID | Distance (ly) | Spectral Type | 1702 Offset | Score |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Gaia DR3 6765857965600060288** | 284 | K-Type | **0.002°** | **31** |
| Gaia DR3 6765857965600060416 | 285 | K-Type | 0.005° | 29 |

> **Hard Truth:** The primary K-type candidate (**...0288**) represents a near-perfect spatial match for the signal's origin window in 1702. This project prioritizes mathematical alignment and historical reconstruction over speculative "placeholder" exoplanet data.

## Research Documentation
The foundational logic for **Project Sagittarius** is contained within the following technical files:

1.  **[Full Research Paper](./Final%20Project.md)** – The comprehensive study and forensic analysis.
2.  **[Abstract](./Abstract.md)** – High-level goals and "Cold Case" reframing.
3.  **[Scientific Validity Statement](./Scientific%20Validity%20Statement.md)** – Technical justification of the astrometric methods.
4.  **[Candidate Ranking Matrix](./Candidate%20Ranking%20Matrix.md)** – Detailed 0–5 scoring breakdown for each star.
5.  **[Candidate Stars Table](./Candidate%20Stars%20Table.md)** – Full astrophysical metadata for the search pool.

## Extensibility
This framework is designed to be **reproducible**. It serves as a blueprint for tracing other non-repeating signals, such as Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) or other historical radio anomalies, by substituting coordinate and distance parameters.
