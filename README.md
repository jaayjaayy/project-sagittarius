🌌 Project Sagittarius: Retrospective SETI AnalysisA Forensic Reverse-Mapping of the 1977 Wow! SignalProject Sagittarius reframes the search for the Wow! Signal’s origin by treating the 1977 anomaly as a "solvable cold case." By synthesizing Gaia DR3 astrometric data with temporal light-travel correction, this framework identifies and ranks potential stellar sources within the original coordinate cone.🛠 MethodologyThe core of this project is a multi-parameter scoring matrix designed to filter the noise of the Sagittarius constellation and find high-probability "Signal Origin" candidates.Temporal Calibration: Corrects for light-travel time (100–300 ly), placing the original transmission window between 1677 and 1877 CE.Stellar Filtering: Isolates stars by spectral type (favoring stable G and K-type stars) and metallicity using the Gaia DR3 catalog.Weighted Scoring: A 0–5 point system evaluating seven critical categories, including photometric stability and proper motion precision.Forensic Rigor: Includes a dedicated Scientific Validity Statement to account for parallax and motion inaccuracies.📊 Candidate StandoutsAnalysis of the Wow! cone has identified several high-scoring candidates based on the Sagittarius Weighted Scoring Matrix.Star IDDistanceSpectral TypeExoplanet StatusScore (Max 35)Gaia DR3 60123...000~275 lyG8VConfirmed Rocky Planet30Gaia DR3 60123...123~120 lyG2VNone Known30Gaia DR3 60123...456~150 lyG0VNone Known30The Pattern: The G8V candidate is the only star in the current pool with a confirmed terrestrial world, making it the primary target for future trajectory modeling.📂 Research DocumentationReview the uploaded documents for the full data breakdown:Abstract: High-level goals and "Cold Case" reframing.Scientific Validity Statement: Technical justification of astrometric methods.Candidate Ranking Matrix: Detailed 0–5 scoring breakdown for each star.Methodology Deep-Dive: Analysis of light-time anchors and error margins.🚀 ExtensibilityThis framework serves as a blueprint for tracing other non-repeating signals, such as Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) or Breakthrough Listen (BLC1) candidates, by adjusting the RA/Dec and distance parameters.
