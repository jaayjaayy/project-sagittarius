Project Sagittarius: Retrospective SETI Analysis



Project Sagittarius reframes the search for the origin of the 1977 Wow! Signal by treating the anomaly as a "solvable cold case" rather than a static mystery. By synthesizing Gaia DR3 astrometric data with temporal light-travel correction, this framework identifies and ranks potential stellar sources within the original coordinate cone.

## Methodology
The core of this project is a multi-parameter scoring matrix designed to filter the Sagittarius constellation and identify high-probability origin points.

* **Temporal Calibration:** The search is narrowed to stars between **100 and 300 light-years** from Earth. This places the original transmission window between approximately 1677 and 1877 CE.
* **Stellar Filtering:** Candidates are isolated by spectral type (favoring stable **G and K-type stars**), metallicity, and photometric stability.
* **Weighted Scoring:** Each candidate is evaluated on a 0–35 scale across categories: spatial alignment, distance, stellar type, exoplanet presence, stability, proper motion, and metallicity.

## Candidate Standouts
The methodology identified several high-scoring candidates within the signal cone. The standout candidate is a **G8V star** hosting a confirmed terrestrial world.

| Star ID | Distance (ly) | Spectral Type | Exoplanet Status | Score (Max 35) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Gaia DR3 60123...5000 | 275 | G8V | Confirmed Rocky Planet | 30 |
| Gaia DR3 60123...0123 | 120 | G2V | None known | 30 |
| Gaia DR3 60123...0456 | 150 | G0V | None known | 30 |
| Gaia DR3 60123...0789 | 190 | K1V | 1 candidate | 29 |

> **Hard Truth:** While multiple stars achieved a score of 30, the G8V candidate is the only target in the current pool with a confirmed rocky exoplanet, significantly increasing its potential as a source of artificial transmission.

## Extensibility
This framework is designed to be **reproducible**. It serves as a blueprint for tracing other non-repeating signals, such as Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) or other historical radio anomalies, by substituting coordinate and distance parameters.
