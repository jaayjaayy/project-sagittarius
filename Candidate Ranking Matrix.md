# Candidate Discussion & Ranking

Each of the four candidate stars identified within the Wow! Signal cone was evaluated against a multi-factor scoring model. Scores were assigned on a **0–5 scale across seven categories**, representing key attributes for an intentional signal origin.

## The Scoring Logic
* **📍 Location:** Spatial alignment within the detection cone.
* **🪐 Distance:** Alignment with the 100–300 ly temporal window.
* **🌞 Spectral:** Stellar classification (G/K types preferred).
* **🌎 Exoplanets:** Known or candidate terrestrial worlds.
* **📈 Stability:** Low photometric variability.
* **📡 Motion:** Proper motion precision.
* **🧬 Metallicity:** Heavy-element ratios ([Fe/H]).

| Star ID | 📍 | 🪐 | 🌞 | 🌎 | 📈 | 📡 | 🧬 | ⭐ Total |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Gaia DR3 ...5000** | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 3 | 3 | 4 | **30** |
| **Gaia DR3 ...0123** | 5 | 5 | 5 | 1 | 5 | 5 | 4 | **30** |
| **Gaia DR3 ...0456** | 5 | 5 | 5 | 1 | 5 | 4 | 5 | **30** |
| **Gaia DR3 ...0789** | 5 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 3 | **29** |

> **Hard Truth:** While three candidates achieved a score of 30, the **G8V star (...5000)** is the standout. The presence of a confirmed rocky planet outweighs its moderate variability, making it the highest-priority "cold case" target.
