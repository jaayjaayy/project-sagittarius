# Candidate Discussion & Ranking

Each of the four candidate stars identified within the Wow! Signal cone was evaluated against a multi-factor scoring model. Scores were assigned on a **0–5 scale across seven categories**, representing key attributes for an intentional signal origin.

## The Scoring Logic
* **📍 Location:** Spatial alignment within the detection cone.
* **🪐 Distance:** Alignment with the 100–300 ly temporal window.
* **🌞 Spectral:** Stellar classification (G/K types preferred).
* **🌎 Exoplanets:** Known or candidate terrestrial worlds.
* **📈 Stability:** Low photometric variability.
* **📡 Motion:** Proper motion precision.
* **🧬 Metallicity:** Heavy-element ratios ([Fe/H]).

> **Hard Truth:** The K-type Orange Dwarf (**...0288**) is the definitive winner of the 1702 Reconstruction. Its spatial offset of only 0.002 degrees from the Wow! Signal center during the estimated transmission era makes it the most mathematically viable origin point in this dataset.
